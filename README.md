# SDC:LX Bookkeeper for React Advanced 2021

This repository is the foundation for the presentation done for [React Advanced 2021](https://reactadvanced.com/) about [To mock or not to mock, that is the question!](https://github.com/ritamcastro/sharing-is-caring/tree/main/react-advanced-2021).

To run it, do:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

Be aware that the list of books that are shown is hard-coded. If you do want to make it more "real", you'll need to create a backend for this. :)

I hope you enjoy!
